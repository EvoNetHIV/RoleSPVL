  # Description:
  #   Uses a difference equation to determine CD4 counts 
  #   CD4 counts drop as the square root of log VL
  #
  # Inputs:
  #    dat$pop: V
  #    dat$param: CD4count_end_stage
  # Outputs: 
  #   dat$pop: CD4count, CD4, RandomTimeToAIDS, CD4_time_death

  #  ** The following constants have been hard-coded into the function for the moment **
  #      - Rate at which CD4 declines with log VL (hard-coded to be 0.045)
  #      - Minimal VL below which CD4 stops declining (hard-coded to be 1.0)
  #
  #  ** This version is NOT designed to work with treatment **  
  
   
   #   Define population with VL greater than a pre-specified mininum (1.) for CD4 killing
   #   Added b/c logV will be negative for VL's < 1 ==> VL-induced increases in CD4's!
