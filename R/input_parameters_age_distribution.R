  ########## Alternative AMSR tables that include elderly persons. #########################
  # Data obtained from the CDC "WONDER" webpage (wonder.cdc.gov) for USA men from 1999-2003
  # downloaded on 8/25/15.  The CDC data only apply to people 85 and under.  To fill in
  # the rest, I (John) made various extrapolations and approximations, as follows... 
  #  (1) In the absence of data, I assumed zero people over 85 years at the beginning of the
  #      simulation.  The model does, however, allow people to age-in to ages 86-100 over time.
  #  (2) Death rate data for those over 86 were obtained from Society of Actuaries' "Social
  #      Security" data set (pretty closely matches the CDC estimate for those 85!).  Obtained from
  #      https://www.soa.org/research/software-tools/research-simple-life-calculator.aspx 
  #      downloaded on 8/25/15.
  #  (3) To keep this from getting totally out of hand, I assumed a 0% chance of living past 100. 
  #
  # While these approximations and extrapolations are imperfect, I figure that the advanced
  # elderly are rare enough (and so inactive sexually) that any imperfections will have
  # little-to-no effect on our conclusions.
  #
  #  Note: Eldery persons can easily be excluded from the simulations by setting max_age to 
  #        something less than 100 (current default, as of 8/25/15, is max_age = 55 years)
